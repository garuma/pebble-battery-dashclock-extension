An extension to display your Pebble current battery level in the excellent [DashClock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock) lock screen widget.

Also showcase two bindings, one for the Pebble Android SDK and one for Dashclock extension API.

*(NB: Pebble is only capable of reporting very coarse-grained battery estimates, in practise battery level may vary unexpectedly)*
